# Overview Document for the CIT (Comprehensible Input Tracker) App

## Brief Description

This is an application that will allow me to more efficiently learn Dutch. I believe in a mixture of comprehensible input from interesting sources (podcasts, tv shows, movies) and revising sentences sentences that are of use for you personally. I usually get these sentences from the comprehensable input and write them down to revise at a later date. Over and over again I have done this and found massive improvement in my Dutch. I, however, started running into problems with the length of the list of sentences I'm having to revise, spending double the amount of time revising as actually listening to the language.

This led me to come up with a solution involving reading a set amount of sentence that are both random but also trying to consistently cover all the sentences I have. Thus, not having complete randomness. I also have slowly become tired of the paper and the drawbacks it brings like wear and tear, the book becoming thick and uncomfortable to manuever and so on. 

Finally, I came up with the idea to put my software engineering skills to use and make and appllication that hopefully solves all these problems and will finally help me learn Dutch at the desired speed and ease. 

## User Stories/Scenarios

Within this application there is realistically only one user who for brevity we will just call ... User.


- As a User I must be able to add new sentence pairs(an English sentence and its Dutch translation).
- As a User I must be able to search for and modify a past sentence pair.
- As a User I must be able to read series of random English sentences and then check the Dutch equivilant for each. 
- As a User I must be able to toggle hide/show the Dutch equivilant of the sentence infinitely before moving to the next sentence pair.
- As a User I don't want certain sentence pairs to be shown more often then others because then my coverage of the learning material won't be consistent.
